The Gut Microbiota and Alzheimer's Disease,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28372330/,"The gut microbiota comprises a complex community of microorganism species that resides in our gastrointestinal ecosystem and whose alterations influence not only various gut disorders but also central nervous system disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD, the most common form of dementia, is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with impaired cognition and cerebral accumulation of amyloid-β peptides (Aβ). Most notably, the microbiota-gut-brain axis is a bidirectional communication system that is not fully understood, but includes neural, immune, endocrine, and metabolic pathways. Studies in germ-free animals and in animals exposed to pathogenic microbial infections, antibiotics, probiotics, or fecal microbiota transplantation suggest a role for the gut microbiota in host cognition or AD-related pathogenesis. The increased permeability of the gut and blood-brain barrier induced by microbiota dysbiosis may mediate or affect AD pathogenesis and other neurodegenerative disorders, especially those associated with aging. In addition, bacteria populating the gut microbiota can secrete large amounts of amyloids and lipopolysaccharides, which might contribute to the modulation of signaling pathways and the production of proinflammatory cytokines associated with the pathogenesis of AD. Moreover, imbalances in the gut microbiota can induce inflammation that is associated with the pathogenesis of obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and AD. The purpose of this review is to summarize and discuss the current findings that may elucidate the role of the gut microbiota in the development of AD. Understanding the underlying mechanisms may provide new insights into novel therapeutic strategies for AD.",AD,28372330,10.3233/JAD-161141,Alzheimer's
Alzheimer's disease,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24234352/,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative cause of dementia and is responsible for significant individual morbidity and mortality, and economic impact on the health care system. Neurodegeneration (including neuronal atrophy and/or loss) are attributed to extraneuronal toxic amyloid oligomers and proteins, intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles consisting of hyperphosphorylated tau, region-specific diminished cerebral glucose metabolism, synaptic dysfunction, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Several of these pathologic changes may occur decades before symptom onset, leaving ample time for implementing prevention strategies that target the earliest stages of the disease. In recent years, a myriad of modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors have been elucidated. We describe the latest criteria for the diagnosis of AD, including earliest diagnostic stage of preclinical AD, which has the highest potential for research, including diagnosis and disease modification. We discuss both FDA-approved pharmacologic treatments, as well as nonpharmacologic strategies for AD therapeutics, including prevention via evidence-based, low-risk interventions. Genotype is an important consideration in managing patients on the AD continuum, as presence of the APOE ε4 allele may influence response to treatment. We present the most current evidence relating to pharmacogenomics, nutrigenomics, and distinctive nutritional requirements targeted toward AD.",AD|FDA|APOE,24234352,10.1055/s-0033-1359319,Alzheimer's
2016 Alzheimer's disease facts and figures,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27570871/,"This report describes the public health impact of Alzheimer's disease, including incidence and prevalence, mortality rates, costs of care, and the overall impact on caregivers and society. It also examines in detail the financial impact of Alzheimer's on families, including annual costs to families and the difficult decisions families must often make to pay those costs. An estimated 5.4 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease. By mid-century, the number of people living with Alzheimer's disease in the United States is projected to grow to 13.8 million, fueled in large part by the aging baby boom generation. Today, someone in the country develops Alzheimer's disease every 66 seconds. By 2050, one new case of Alzheimer's is expected to develop every 33 seconds, resulting in nearly 1 million new cases per year. In 2013, official death certificates recorded 84,767 deaths from Alzheimer's disease, making it the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth leading cause of death in Americans age ≥ 65 years. Between 2000 and 2013, deaths resulting from stroke, heart disease, and prostate cancer decreased 23%, 14%, and 11%, respectively, whereas deaths from Alzheimer's disease increased 71%. The actual number of deaths to which Alzheimer's disease contributes is likely much larger than the number of deaths from Alzheimer's disease recorded on death certificates. In 2016, an estimated 700,000 Americans age ≥ 65 years will die with Alzheimer's disease, and many of them will die because of the complications caused by Alzheimer's disease. In 2015, more than 15 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 18.1 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer's and other dementias, a contribution valued at more than $221 billion. Average per-person Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age ≥ 65 years with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias are more than two and a half times as great as payments for all beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are 19 times as great. Total payments in 2016 for health care, long-term care and hospice services for people age ≥ 65 years with dementia are estimated to be $236 billion. The costs of Alzheimer's care may place a substantial financial burden on families, who often have to take money out of their retirement savings, cut back on buying food, and reduce their own trips to the doctor. In addition, many family members incorrectly believe that Medicare pays for nursing home care and other types of long-term care. Such findings highlight the need for solutions to prevent dementia-related costs from jeopardizing the health and financial security of the families of people with Alzheimer's and other dementias.",,27570871,10.1016/j.jalz.2016.03.001,Alzheimer's
Biomarkers for preclinical Alzheimer's disease,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25024325/,"Currently, there is a pressing need to shift the focus to accurate detection of the earliest phase of increasingly preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). Meanwhile, the growing recognition that the pathophysiological process of AD begins many years prior to clinically obvious symptoms and the concept of a presymptomatic or preclinical stage of AD are becoming more widely accepted. Advances in clinical identification of new measurements will be critical not only in the discovery of sensitive, specific, and reliable biomarkers of preclinical AD but also in the development of tests that will aid in the early detection and differential diagnosis of dementia and in monitoring disease progression. The goal of this review is to provide an overview of biomarkers for preclinical AD, with emphasis on neuroimaging and neurochemical biomarkers. We conclude with a discussion of emergent directions for AD biomarker research.",AD,25024325,10.3233/JAD-140843,Alzheimer's
Mouse Models of Alzheimer's Disease,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28304309/,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that nowadays affects more than 40 million people worldwide and it is predicted to exponentially increase in the coming decades. Because no curative treatment exists, research on the pathophysiology of the disease, as well as the testing of new drugs, are mandatory. For these purposes, animal models constitute a valuable, although perfectible tool. This review takes a tour through several aspects of mouse models of AD, such as the generation of transgenic models, the relevance of the promoter driving the expression of the transgenes, and the concrete transgenes used to simulate AD pathophysiology. Then, transgenic mouse lines harboring mutated human genes at several loci such as APP, PSEN1, APOEɛ4, and ob (leptin) are reviewed. Therefore, not only the accumulation of the Aβ peptide is emulated but also cholesterol and insulin metabolism. Further novel information about the disease will allow for the development of more accurate animal models, which in turn will undoubtedly be helpful for bringing preclinical research closer to clinical trials in humans.",PSEN1|AD|APP,28304309,10.3233/JAD-170045,Alzheimer's
Molecular mechanisms of neuropathological changes in Alzheimer's disease: a review,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23553131/,"More than 100 years after description of Alzheimer's disease (AD), two major pathological processes observed already by Alois Alzheimer, remain as the main explanation of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Important molecular interactions leading to AD neuropathology were described in amyloid cascade and in tau protein function. No clinical trials with novel therapies based on amyloid cascade and tau protein hypotheses have been successful. The main aim of recent research is focused on the question what is primary mechanism leading to the molecular development of AD pathology. Promising explanation of triggering mechanism can be seen in vascular pathology that have direct influence on the development of pathological processes typical for Alzheimer disease. Novel insight into a number of cellular signaling mechanisms, as well as mitochondrial function in Alzheimer disease could also bring explanations of initial processes leading to the development of this pathology.",AD,23553131,10.5114/fn.2013.34190,Alzheimer's
"Recent Progress in Alzheimer's Disease Research, Part 3: Diagnosis and Treatment",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28269772/,"The field of Alzheimer's disease (AD) research has grown exponentially over the past few decades, especially since the isolation and identification of amyloid-β from postmortem examination of the brains of AD patients. Recently, the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (JAD) put forth approximately 300 research reports which were deemed to be the most influential research reports in the field of AD since 2010. JAD readers were asked to vote on these most influential reports. In this 3-part review, we review the results of the 300 most influential AD research reports to provide JAD readers with a readily accessible, yet comprehensive review of the state of contemporary research. Notably, this multi-part review identifies the ""hottest"" fields of AD research providing guidance for both senior investigators as well as investigators new to the field on what is the most pressing fields within AD research. Part 1 of this review covers pathogenesis, both on a molecular and macro scale. Part 2 review genetics and epidemiology, and part 3 covers diagnosis and treatment. This part of the review, diagnosis and treatment, reviews the latest diagnostic criteria, biomarkers, imaging, and treatments in AD.",AD|JAD,28269772,10.3233/JAD-160907,Alzheimer's
Female Sex and Alzheimer's Risk: The Menopause Connection,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30298180/,"Along with advanced age and apolipoprotein E (APOE)-4 genotype, female sex is a major risk factor for developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Considering that AD pathology begins decades prior to clinical symptoms, the higher risk in women cannot simply be accounted for by their greater longevity as compared to men. Recent investigation into sex-specific pathophysiological mechanisms behind AD risk has implicated the menopause transition (MT), a midlife neuroendocrine transition state unique to females. Commonly characterized as ending in reproductive senescence, many symptoms of MT are neurological, including disruption of estrogen-regulated systems such as thermoregulation, sleep, and circadian rhythms, as well as depression and impairment in multiple cognitive domains. Preclinical studies have shown that, during MT, the estrogen network uncouples from the brain bioenergetic system. The resulting hypometabolic state could serve as the substrate for neurological dysfunction. Indeed, translational brain imaging studies demonstrate that 40-60 year-old perimenopausal and postmenopausal women exhibit an AD-endophenotype characterized by decreased metabolic activity and increased brain amyloid-beta deposition as compared to premenopausal women and to age-matched men. This review discusses the MT as a window of opportunity for therapeutic interventions to compensate for brain bioenergetic crisis and combat the subsequent increased risk for AD in women.",APOE|AD|MT,30298180,10.14283/jpad.2018.34,Alzheimer's
Neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease: Current evidence and future directions,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27179961/,"Several attempts have been made to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD) using anti-amyloid strategies with disappointing results. It is clear that the ""amyloid cascade hypothesis"" alone cannot fully explain the neuronal damage in AD, as evidenced both by autopsy and imaging studies. Neuroinflammation plays a significant role in neurodegenerative diseases, whereas the debate is ongoing about its precise role, whether it is protective or harmful. In this review, we focus on the potential mechanism of glial activation and how local and systemic factors influence disease progression. We focus on neuroinflammation in AD, especially in the earliest stages, a vicious cycle of glial priming, release of pro-inflammatory factors, and neuronal damage. We review the evidence from imaging studies, regarding the temporal relationship between amyloid deposition and neuroinflammation, the influence of systemic inflammation on glial activation, both in acute and chronic stimulation and the relevance of inflammation as a diagnostic and therapeutic target.",AD,27179961,10.1016/j.jalz.2016.02.010,Alzheimer's
