Diabetes insipidus in infants and children,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27156767/,"Diabetes insipidus, the inability to concentrate urine resulting in polyuria and polydipsia, can have different manifestations and management considerations in infants and children compared to adults. Central diabetes insipidus, secondary to lack of vasopressin production, is more common in children than is nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, the inability to respond appropriately to vasopressin. The goal of treatment in both forms of diabetes insipidus is to decrease urine output and thirst while allowing for appropriate fluid balance, normonatremia and ensuring an acceptable quality of life for each patient. An infant's obligate need to consume calories as liquid and the need for readjustment of medication dosing in growing children both present unique challenges for diabetes insipidus management in the pediatric population. Treatment modalities typically include vasopressin or thiazide diuretics. Special consideration must be given when managing diabetes insipidus in the adipsic patient, post-surgical patient, and in those undergoing chemotherapy or receiving medications that alter free water clearance.",,27156767,10.1016/j.beem.2016.02.006,diabetes
Genetics of Diabetes Insipidus,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28476225/,"Diabetes insipidus is a disease characterized by polyuria and polydipsia due to inadequate release of arginine vasopressin from the posterior pituitary gland (neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus) or due to arginine vasopressin insensitivity by the renal distal tubule, leading to a deficiency in tubular water reabsorption (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus). This article reviews the genetics of diabetes insipidus in the context of its diagnosis, clinical presentation, and therapy.",,28476225,10.1016/j.ecl.2017.01.002,diabetes
"Pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26077742/,"Healthy kidneys maintain fluid and electrolyte homoeostasis by adjusting urine volume and composition according to physiological needs. The final urine composition is determined in the last tubular segment: the collecting duct. Water permeability in the collecting duct is regulated by arginine vasopressin (AVP). Secretion of AVP from the neurohypophysis is regulated by a complex signalling network that involves osmosensors, barosensors and volume sensors. AVP facilitates aquaporin (AQP)-mediated water reabsorption via activation of the vasopressin V2 receptor (AVPR2) in the collecting duct, thus enabling concentration of urine. In nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), inability of the kidneys to respond to AVP results in functional AQP deficiency. Consequently, affected patients have constant diuresis, resulting in large volumes of dilute urine. Primary forms of NDI result from mutations in the genes that encode the key proteins AVPR2 and AQP2, whereas secondary forms are associated with biochemical abnormalities, obstructive uropathy or the use of certain medications, particularly lithium. Treatment of the disease is informed by identification of the underlying cause. Here we review the clinical aspects and diagnosis of NDI, the various aetiologies, current treatment options and potential future developments.",AVP|AQP|V2|AVPR2|NDI|AQP2,26077742,10.1038/nrneph.2015.89,diabetes
Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30454745/,"Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) results from the inability of the late distal tubules and collecting ducts to respond to vasopressin. The lack of ability to concentrate urine results in polyuria and polydipsia. Primary and acquired forms of NDI exist in children. Congenital NDI is a result of mutation in AVPR2 or AQP2 genes. Secondary NDI is associated with electrolyte abnormalities, obstructive uropathy, or certain medications. Management of NDI can be difficult with only symptomatic treatment available, using low-solute diet, diuretics, and prostaglandin inhibitors.",NDI|AVPR2|AQP2,30454745,10.1016/j.pcl.2018.09.006,diabetes
Diabetes insipidus: Differential diagnosis and management,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27156759/,"Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a syndrome characterized by the excretion of abnormally large volumes of dilute urine. It can be caused by any of 4 fundamentally different defects that must be distinguished for safe and effective management. They are: (1) pituitary DI, due to inadequate production and secretion of antidiuretic hormone, arginine-vasopressin (AVP); (2) gestational DI due to degradation of AVP by an enzyme made in placenta; (3) primary polydipsia, due to suppression of AVP secretion by excessive fluid intake; and (4) nephrogenic DI due to renal insensitivity to the antidiuretic effect of AVP. This review describes several methods of differential diagnosis, indicates the advantages and disadvantages of each and presents a new approach that is simpler and less costly but just as reliable as the best of the older methods. The various treatments for the different types of DI and recent findings on the genetic basis of the familial forms of DI are also discussed with emphasis on their contributions to improved diagnosis and management.",DI|AVP,27156759,10.1016/j.beem.2016.02.007,diabetes
